## Installation

### 1. Require the Package

To install the package, run the following command in your Laravel project:

```bash
composer require hijazi/firebase-push
```

### 2. Publish the Configuration and Migration

Next, publish the configuration file and migration using Artisan commands:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Hijazi\FirebasePush\FirebasePushServiceProvider" --tag="firebase-push-config"
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Hijazi\FirebasePush\FirebasePushServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
```

### 3. Run the Migration

Once the migration is published, run it to create the firebase_topics table:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## 4. Configuration

### 1. Firebase Server Key

Add your Firebase Server Key to your .env file:

```bash
FIREBASE_SERVER_KEY=your-firebase-server-key
```

This key is necessary for authenticating requests to Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

### 2. Config File

The configuration file config/firebase_push.php is published to your Laravel application. It contains basic configuration options, including the server key and other relevant settings.

## 5. Usage

## 1. Sending Notifications

Send Notification to Multiple Devices
To send the same notification to multiple devices, use the sendNotification method:

```php
use Hijazi\FirebasePush\FirebasePushService;

$firebasePushService = app(FirebasePushService::class);
$title = "Notification Title";
$body = "This is the body of the notification.";
$tokens = ['device_token1', 'device_token2'];

$response = $firebasePushService->sendNotification($title, $body, $tokens);

if ($response) {
echo "Notification sent successfully.";
} else {
echo "Failed to send notification.";
}
```

## 2. Send Different Notifications to Multiple Devices

To send different notifications to multiple devices, use the sendToMultipleDevices method:

```php
use Hijazi\FirebasePush\FirebasePushService;

$firebasePushService = app(FirebasePushService::class);

$notifications = [
[
'title' => 'First Notification',
'body' => 'This is the first message',
'tokens' => ['device_token1', 'device_token2']
],
[
'title' => 'Second Notification',
'body' => 'This is the second message',
'tokens' => ['device_token3', 'device_token4']
],
];

$responses = $firebasePushService->sendToMultipleDevices($notifications);

foreach ($responses as $response) {
    if ($response) {
echo "Notification sent successfully.";
} else {
echo "Failed to send notification.";
}
}

```

## 3. Send Notification to a Single Device

To send a notification to a single device, use the sendToSingleDevice method:

```php
use Hijazi\FirebasePush\FirebasePushService;

$firebasePushService = app(FirebasePushService::class);
$title = "Single Notification";
$body = "This is the body of the notification.";
$token = 'device_token1';

$response = $firebasePushService->sendToSingleDevice($title, $body, $token);

if ($response) {
echo "Notification sent successfully.";
} else {
echo "Failed to send notification.";
}
```

## 4. Send Notification with Custom Data

To send custom data along with the notification, use the sendWithCustomData method:

```php
use Hijazi\FirebasePush\FirebasePushService;

$firebasePushService = app(FirebasePushService::class);
$title = "Notification with Custom Data";
$body = "This notification includes custom data.";
$tokens = ['device_token1', 'device_token2'];
$customData = ['key1' => 'value1', 'key2' => 'value2'];

$response = $firebasePushService->sendWithCustomData($title, $body, $tokens, $customData);

if ($response) {
echo "Notification sent successfully with custom data.";
} else {
echo "Failed to send notification.";
}
```

## Managing Topics

The package automatically manages topics in your database. You can define topics, check if they are active, and mark them as deleted.

### 1. Send Notification to a Topic

To send a notification to all devices subscribed to a topic, use the sendToTopic method:

```php
use Hijazi\FirebasePush\FirebasePushService;

$firebasePushService = app(FirebasePushService::class);
$topic = "news";
$title = "Breaking News";
$body = "This is a news update.";

$response = $firebasePushService->sendToTopic($title, $body, $topic);

if ($response) {
echo "Notification sent successfully to the topic.";
} else {
echo "Failed to send notification to the topic.";
}
```

### 2. Subscribe Devices to a Topic and Send Notification

To subscribe devices to a topic and then send a notification to that topic, use the subscribeAndSendNotification method:

```php
use Hijazi\FirebasePush\FirebasePushService;

$firebasePushService = app(FirebasePushService::class);
$topic = "news";
$title = "Breaking News";
$body = "This is a news update.";
$tokens = ['device_token1', 'device_token2'];

$response = $firebasePushService->subscribeAndSendNotification($title, $body, $topic, $tokens);

if ($response) {
echo "Devices subscribed and notification sent successfully.";
} else {
echo "Failed to subscribe devices or send notification.";
}
```

### 3. Mark Topic as Deleted

To mark a topic as deleted, preventing further notifications from being sent to that topic, use the markTopicAsDeleted method:

```php
use Hijazi\FirebasePush\FirebasePushService;

$firebasePushService = app(FirebasePushService::class);
$topic = "news";

$firebasePushService->markTopicAsDeleted($topic);

echo "Topic marked as deleted.";
```
